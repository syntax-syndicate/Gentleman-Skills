# Gentleman-Skills

> Community-driven AI agent skills for Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Codex, Windsurf, Antigravity, and other AI assistants.

Skills are specialized instruction sets that teach AI assistants how to work with specific frameworks, libraries, and patterns. They provide on-demand context so the AI writes code following best practices and conventions.

## Philosophy

- **Curated Skills** - Personally crafted and battle-tested by [@Gentleman-Programming](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming). These reflect MY way of thinking about code architecture - Scope Rule, file naming conventions, signals-first approach, and more. Some skills (like testing and Python) have been developed in collaboration with the team at [Prowler](https://github.com/prowler-cloud).

- **Community Skills** - Created by the community, for the community. These go through a democratic voting process before being accepted.

## Curated Skills

These skills represent patterns and practices I've personally tested and refined over years of development.

## Supported Agents & Skills Directory

Each agent reads skills from a specific directory. Copy the skills you want into the right path for your agent:

| Agent | macOS / Linux | Windows |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/skills/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\` |
| **OpenCode** | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\skills\` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `~/.gemini/skills/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\skills\` |
| **Cursor** | `~/.cursor/skills/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\skills\` |
| **VS Code Copilot** | `~/.copilot/skills/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.copilot\skills\` |
| **Codex** | `~/.codex/skills/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\skills\` |
| **Windsurf** | `~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.codeium\windsurf\skills\` |
| **Antigravity** | `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\antigravity\skills\` |

Inside each `skills/` directory, every skill lives in its own folder with a `SKILL.md`:

```
skills/
  react-19/SKILL.md
  typescript/SKILL.md
  angular/core/SKILL.md
  playwright/SKILL.md
  ...
```

## Installation

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/Gentleman-Skills.git

# Copy curated skills to your agent's skills directory
# Replace <SKILLS_DIR> with the path from the table above

# Example: Claude Code (macOS/Linux)
cp -r Gentleman-Skills/curated/* ~/.claude/skills/

# Example: OpenCode (macOS/Linux)
cp -r Gentleman-Skills/curated/* ~/.config/opencode/skills/

# Example: Gemini CLI (macOS/Linux)
cp -r Gentleman-Skills/curated/* ~/.gemini/skills/

# Example: Cursor (macOS/Linux)
cp -r Gentleman-Skills/curated/* ~/.cursor/skills/

# Or copy specific skills only
cp -r Gentleman-Skills/curated/react-19 ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r Gentleman-Skills/curated/typescript ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Manual Installation

1. Create the skills directory for your agent if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   # Example for Claude Code
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills

   # Example for Gemini CLI
   mkdir -p ~/.gemini/skills
   ```

2. Copy the skill folder(s) you want:
   ```bash
   cp -r curated/react-19 ~/.claude/skills/
   ```

3. Reference the skill in your agent's configuration file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code):
   ```markdown
   ## Skills
   When working with React, read `~/.claude/skills/react-19/SKILL.md` first.
   ```

## How Skills Work

Each skill contains a `SKILL.md` file with:

1. **Trigger conditions** - When the AI should load this skill
2. **Patterns and rules** - Specific coding conventions to follow
3. **Code examples** - Reference implementations
4. **Anti-patterns** - What to avoid

When the AI detects a matching context (e.g., editing a React component), it reads the skill file and applies those patterns to its responses.
